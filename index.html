            <p>Hey, I am Hieu. (I know, who even has four vowels in his name?)</p>
            <p>I am a freshman at NYU, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I like both software and hardware. I want to create an advanced AI like Jarvis and a durable multi-functional intelligent suite. Yep, I kinda want to be Iron Man.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I occasionaly fall into deep thought (more like random philosophical bs), and I feel like I have realized many things about life and universal humans' conditions, but most of the time I don&#39;t do well explaining myself to others (do you even know what I have been saying?). Thus, I&#39;ll let my favorite quotes represent different pieces of my mind. Hopefully you can connect them and have a general idea of who I am.</p>
            <br>

	            <blockquote>
	            	<p>I am a man because of two words, You may. It's my choice.</p>
	            	<p>&mdash; East of Eden</p>

	            	<p>&mdash; Siddhartha (Hermann Hesse)</p>
	            </blockquote> -->

If you allow yourself to feel it, embrace it, it will make you more powerful than you've ever imagined. It's the greatest gift we have: to bear their pain without breaking. And it comes from the most human part of us: hope.</p>

            	<h4>Built at hackNY 2015.</h4>
            	<br>
            	<img src="img/imagely.png" alt="" class="post-thumb">
            	<p>Imagely is a language learning tool that associate an image with seven words. Using Clarify's powerful image recognition system, the app retrieves words associated with the image url inputed by the user. It then uses Yandex translation API to translate those words into a language of the user's choice. Current supported languages are: Spanish, Russian, Vietnamese, Dutch and Hebrew. My team also think of making a quiz mode that will allow users to bookmark important words and review later.</p>

            	<h3>Notr: Text Visualization in Mindmapping</h3>
            	<h4>Built at HackMIT 2015, my first hackathon in the US!</h4>
            	<br>
            	<img src="img/notr.png" alt="" class="post-thumb">
            	<p>Notr is a text visualization software based on AngularJS with dynamic mind mapping capabilities. Mindmapping is awesome, but drawing one takes time and effort. Notr can render graphs based on input text with simple syntax and structure. It is a text based application that can parse the nodal relationships and render them on a graph. UI combines a text editor and a display for the graph. -@, #, -, and id. (Parser). -render graph with said relationships. This project is possible thanks to Ace.c9.io, angular-ui-ace, d3.js, ui-bootstrap</p>

            	<h4>Second Prize - Built at Hackademics Vietnam 2015, my first hackathon ever!</h4>
            	<br>
            	<img src="img/sia.png" alt="" class="post-thumb">
            	<p>A sex education website designed to provide useful info and interactive data to equip teenagers with crucial knowledge about psychophysiological issues. These include but is not limited to safe sex, choice, and gender. The information is aggregated from trusted source and comes in various forms such as articles, charts, graphs, scenarios, et cetera. A sharing section also allows teens to post any concerns to receive advice, or simply to share their personal stories. This project is built based on: angular-google-chart and angular bootstrap.</p>

            	<h3>Home Thermostat</h3>
            	<h4>First hardware project!</h4>
            	<br>
            	<img src="img/thermostat.jpg" alt="" class="post-thumb">
            	<p>A simple, elegant home thermostat built with Arduino Uno. The temperature used in this project is TMP36, which is decent despite some inaccucracy. The sensor converts the change in voltage into temperature. The conversion process happens in the Arduino, an aweosome powerful microcontroller, which then displays the results onto the liquid display. It was a quick weekend project, and I had lots of fun doing it!</p>
