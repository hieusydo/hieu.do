            <p>I am interested in both software and hardware.</p>
            <p>With experience in web development, I built a platform where Vietnamese teenagers can share psycho-physiological issues and receive information as well as support. The project was formed at Vietnam Hackademics 2015, a national hackathon for educational products, won 2nd prize, and continued to be developed up to now under the mentorship of Platform5 (www.platform5.ch) a professional UI/UX company.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I also enjoyed tinkering with Arduino and Raspberry Pi. My first Arduino project was a home thermostat with an additional UI on an LCD display. Currently, I am looking into computer security using the Raspberry Pi running Kali Linux. At YHack, I hope to delve more into my interest, connect to other people and learn from them as well.</p>
            <p>Here are my projects: </p>

            <p>A few months ago I adopted the life motto that I should do whatever I want as long as I am happy. At first I equated happiness with love and desire.</p>
            <p>What does that mean? I have my family always by my side and my relatives who warmly welcome me to the US; I am happy. I enjoy the camaraderies of a few friends and my personality tends to be well-liked by others; I am happy. When thinking of the future, I assure myself that as long as I have a stable job together with a caring wife and lovely children, I will enjoy my life and, thus, be happy.</p>
            <p>However, is happiness just as simple as settlement? That isn&rsquo;t true happiness, is it? That is more like security and satisfaction. I am satisfied with a stable family, a secure employment, a close circle of friends. In a way, that is not true happiness, however.</p>
            <p>Happiness is the jolt of feeling when I get an internship or an admittance letter for which I have long fought. It is the exhilaration when I finally understand a concept and feel that my knowledge has been widened.</p>
            <p>In other words, happiness comes as a fleeting moment after an excruciating struggle. It is the product, or byproduct, of a challenge.</p>
            <p>Therefore, to be happy in life means to throw myself at challenges, which is to read a book every month, to familiarize myself with the advanced algorithm, to do mental math (ha!), to solve logic/discrete math, to read people&rsquo;s mind, etc. &mdash; for the sole purpose of curiosity and happiness.</p>
