If you are building a complete web application with multiple API calls, chances are you will run into the CORS issue. So what is it?

CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It is a mechanism that allows access of resources across domains. For example, domain A wants to load resource B1 from domain B. Traditionally, under the same-origin policy, you will get slapped by this red line:

![CORS-console](/assets/images/cors-1.png){:class="img-responsive"}

`No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:5000' is therefore not allowed access.`

That issue is, in fact, supposed to protect you and your users from malicious requests trying to get unauthorized acces to sensitive data. The traditional same-origin policy enforces that a website can only access data of another site if they both share the same origin (a combination of URI, host name, and port number).

Luckily, nowadays CORS support is a standard. Enabling CORS can be done in both the server and client. On the client side, all cross-origin requests must set the appropriate HTTP headers before sending to the server. On the server side, the server must be configured depending on the language and framework. 

Some examples of sending cross-origin requests are discussed in detail in this <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS" target="_blank">Mozilla Web Docs article</a>. 

On the server side, a brief introduction can be found on <a href="https://enable-cors.org/server.html" target="_blank">Enable-CORS</a>. It also includes resources on how to implement CORS for different platforms. In my case, when working on my Flask application, I used <a href="http://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">Flask-CORS</a>.

Overall, the CORS specfication is a complicated topic. If you run into a problematic scenario, feel free to drop a comment below. 

Cheers!

<em> <b>A Chronicle of Bugs</b> series is my attempt to keep a log of some interesting issues I encounter while working on various projects. My motivation is to stay away from <a href="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/000/246/copypasta.jpg" target="_blank">copypasta</a>, so by writing about those issues, I strive to understand them better. I share my log here in case an Internet wanderer might find it useful.</em>
